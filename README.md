# SOW

S.O.W. = Shower of way

Goal of this application is to store articles, influencers, and self-written tutorials to solve problems I run up against while developing applications. Too many times have I found a decent article that helped me solve an issue, then I left the project idle or moved onto another application and forgotten how I solved something. My hope is that this application will allow me and others to curate useful articles for quicker retrieval and resolution to lost and forgotten knowledge

## In progress
